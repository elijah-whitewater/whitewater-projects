This is a repository of p5.js assignments.

The .zip files are renamed from their originals, to help seperate them if they are downloaded. 

Lab Assignment Six was my solution to creating shapes and motion using values from an array. It was meant to be in the theme of 'Halloween", "Retro-Games", or "Nature" which is why there is a pumpkin and the words "Happy Halloween!"

Lab Assignment Seven was an assignment where we had to create functions to draw shapes. We also had to use a number of new methods that we haven't used before, such as scale(), push(), and pop(). The theme was "Weather" or "Retro-Games", and I went for weather, which is why there is clouds and a sun. 

Lab Assignment Eight was our first time uploading and using images and gifs within code, which is why there is the gif of rain and the uploaded "man" image that moves along the screen with the mouse. It was the first time we had to edit size, font, and the color of text too.
